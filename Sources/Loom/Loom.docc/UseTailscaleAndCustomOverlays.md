# Use Tailscale and Custom Overlays

Loom's overlay support is intentionally narrow. It does not talk to the Tailscale admin API, Headscale, or your inventory service for you. Instead it gives you two transport-level pieces:

- a small overlay probe listener published by ``LoomNode``
- a seed-driven directory built with ``LoomOverlayDirectory``

That split is deliberate. Your app owns which hosts exist and which ones are trusted. Loom owns the Loom-native probe, identity validation, and direct-session planning built on top of those hosts.

## Treat Tailscale as direct connectivity

When two devices can reach each other over Tailscale, Loom should treat that path as a direct transport, not as signaling-only remote presence.

The usual setup is:

1. publish a local overlay probe listener on each host
2. feed ``LoomOverlayDirectory`` with MagicDNS names or stable tailnet IP addresses
3. let Loom race the overlay candidate before falling back to signaling

If you are using `LoomKit`, setting `overlayDirectory` on the container configuration is enough. When the overlay configuration omits `probePort`, the container uses Loom's default overlay probe port and wires that same probe port into the underlying ``LoomNode`` automatically.

```swift
let container = try LoomContainer(
    for: LoomContainerConfiguration(
        serviceType: "_studio._tcp",
        serviceName: "Studio Mac",
        overlayDirectory: LoomOverlayDirectoryConfiguration(
            refreshInterval: .seconds(30),
            probeTimeout: .seconds(2),
            probeAttempts: 3,
            probeRetryDelay: .milliseconds(250),
            seedProvider: {
                [
                    LoomOverlaySeed(host: "studio-mac.tailnet.example"),
                    LoomOverlaySeed(host: "100.64.0.25"),
                ]
            }
        )
    )
)
```

Use multiple probe attempts when the overlay interface may still be warming up after app launch or foregrounding. A single refresh still publishes one coherent peer set; retry attempts only make transient seed misses less visible to the caller.

Use `LoomKitPortConfiguration` when a LoomKit app needs a different listener port:

```swift
let container = try LoomContainer(
    for: LoomContainerConfiguration(
        serviceType: "_studio._tcp",
        serviceName: "Studio Mac",
        ports: LoomKitPortConfiguration(
            overlayProbePort: 9952
        ),
        overlayDirectory: LoomOverlayDirectoryConfiguration(
            seedProvider: {
                [LoomOverlaySeed(host: "studio-mac.tailnet.example")]
            }
        )
    )
)
```

If you are using ``Loom`` directly, set `overlayProbePort` on ``LoomNetworkConfiguration`` for the local node and construct ``LoomOverlayDirectory`` yourself for remote peer resolution.

## Keep signaling as a fallback, not the primary plan

Overlay-discovered peers can still advertise signaling reachability. That is the useful shape for Tailscale: use the tailnet path when it is reachable, but keep signaling available when the overlay host is stale, asleep, or currently blocked by policy.

The key design point is that ``LoomConnectionCoordinator`` plans overlay connectivity before signaling without discarding signaling fallback. Your app does not need separate policy branches just because the same peer is visible through both systems.

## Build custom seed providers from your own control plane

`LoomOverlayDirectory` only needs host hints. The seed provider can come from any source you already own:

- a Tailscale or Headscale-backed service inventory
- CloudKit records that store overlay host names
- a product control plane or bootstrap service
- a static list of lab machines or office hosts

```swift
let overlayDirectory = LoomOverlayDirectory(
    configuration: LoomOverlayDirectoryConfiguration(
        refreshInterval: .seconds(15),
        probeTimeout: .seconds(1),
        seedProvider: {
            let records = try await inventoryClient.fetchReachableHosts()
            return records.map { record in
                LoomOverlaySeed(
                    host: record.host,
                    probePort: record.overlayProbePort
                )
            }
        }
    )
)
```

Each ``LoomOverlaySeed`` contains only a host and an optional probe-port override. That keeps the boundary clean:

- your app owns naming, inventory, and access control
- Loom validates that a host actually answers with a Loom advertisement
- discovered peers still become ordinary ``LoomPeer`` values that participate in the normal connection pipeline

## Operational guidance

- Use the default probe port unless you have a concrete collision. A fixed shared port keeps deployment and firewall policy simpler.
- Keep the seed list small and intentional. The directory probes every seed on each refresh interval.
- Do not overload overlay seeds with app-specific metadata. Publish only reachability hints here and keep product schema above Loom.
- If a refresh fails, the directory clears the previous overlay view and republishes when the next refresh succeeds. That behavior is safer than continuing to surface stale hosts.
